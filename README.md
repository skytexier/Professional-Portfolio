# Professional Portfolio Project
 
## Description

For this project we were tasked with making a professional portfolio template from scratch. At a basic level I designed this page to include a navigation bar, a photo of myself, a title card and small sections for my bio, my contact info and examples of my work. More of the CSS meat can be found in the flex boxes for the application images and links. My intention was to make a somewhat basic UI, to make its styling resize at a given width, and to make a interactive application images which link to other websites.

The intention behind building this portfolio page is to lay down a foundation for a future, obviously much tighter, professional portfolio. This page will act as a sort of resume in itself once its completed and filled out with working apps. 

Some problems I came across were general styling issues and mix ups. It seems a lot of CSS is tweaking things around to find the right fit. Starting with a page design was definitely useful and helped guide my intentions behind the code.

## Installation
 
For proper installation or usage of the website include index.html, style folder and images folder. No installation required unless modifying code, in such case proper git pulling from the repo and importing into editing software required.
 
## Usage

This webpage will allow users to access future applications and links by clicking on image elements as pictured below.

Similarly the nav bar currently links users to different sections of my portfolio, which can always be refactored to link elsewhere or to create a whole new set of nav buttons.

Currently clicking on all images will take you to my instagram page!
